Why does this documentation exist?
----------------------------------
As of 03/2020, a lot of the offical SparkAR documentation has many flaws. These include:

* gaps from not being updated; Spark versions outpacing documentation
* functions not well explained
* types not well explained
* more plain english explanations needed without digging through tutorials
* going back to the index page causes the whole page to freak out
* some green lins are clickable to go to another page, others aren't
* some modules can't be used at all, others can't be used without project capabilities

SparkAR Studio is a wonderful tool, but holds many frustrations for developers. This documentation will hopefully address that issue.

Fully Open Source
-----------------

As I continue to fill out this documentation (usually at the same time as creating my own filters), I would love other developers to add documentation as well. The repo can be found here: https://github.com/bramses/sparkar-docs
